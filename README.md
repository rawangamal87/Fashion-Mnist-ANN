# Fashion-Mnist-ANN
Developed a classification model to identify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images across 10 clothing categories (e.g., T-shirts, shoes, bags). Utilized an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to effectively process and classify the images.
